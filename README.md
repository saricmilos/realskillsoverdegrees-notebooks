# YouTube Jupyter Notebooks

Welcome! ðŸ‘‹  
This repository contains all the **Jupyter notebooks** featured in my youtube channel "Real Skills Over Degrees" (https://www.youtube.com/@realskillsoverdegrees) if you are watching in English language and in Serbian language also (https://www.youtube.com/@saricmilos)!
Each notebook is connected to a video tutorial so you can **follow along, run the code, and experiment** yourself.
